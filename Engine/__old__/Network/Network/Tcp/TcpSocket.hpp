/**
 * @brief TCP is a connected protocol, which means that a TCP socket can only communicate with
 * the host it is connected to. It can't send or receive anything if it is not connected.
 *
 * The TCP protocol is reliable but adds a slight overhead. It ensures that your data
 * will always be received in order and without errors (no data corrupted, lost or duplicated).
 *
 * When a socket is connected to a remote host, you can retrieve informations about this host
 * with the GetRemoteAddress and getRemotePort functions. You can also get the local port to
 * which the socket is bound (which is automatically chosen when the socket is connected),
 * with the GetLocalPort function.
 *
 * Sending and receiving data can use either the low-level or the high-level functions.
 * The low-level functions process a raw sequence of bytes, and cannot ensure that one call to
 * Send will exactly match one call to Receive at the other end of the socket.
 *
 * The high-level interface uses packets (see acid::Packet), which are easier to use and
 * provide more safety regarding the data that is exchanged.
 * You can look at the acid::Packet class to get more details about how they work.
 *
 * The socket is automatically disconnected when it is destroyed, but if you want to
 * explicitly close the connection while the socket instance is still alive, you can call disconnect.
