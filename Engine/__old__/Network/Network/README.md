## Why

SFML provides feature rich networking for FTP, HTTP, Tcp sockets, and Udp sockets. Instead of including the entire SFML library just the networking code has been added to Acid. While porting SFML networking system references were ported to C++ standard alternatives and Acid methods. Networking code has been reformatted and restylized.

Because most networking in Acid is similar to SFML [SFML Network Tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/#network-module) can be followed with just a few modifications.
