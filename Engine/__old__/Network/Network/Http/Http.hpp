/**
 * @brief A very simple HTTP client that allows you to communicate with a web server.
 * You can retrieve web pages, send data to an interactive resource,
 * download a remote file, etc. The HTTPS protocol is not supported.
 *
 * The HTTP client is split into 3 classes:
 * \li acid::HttpRequest
 * \li acid::HttpResponse
 * \li acid::Http
 *
 * acid::HttpRequest builds the request that will be sent to the server. A request is made of:
 * \li a method (what you want to do)
 * \li a target URI (usually the name of the web page or file)
 * \li one or more header fields (options that you can pass to the server)
 * \li an optional body (for POST requests)
 *
 * acid::HttpResponse parse the response from the web server and provides getters to read them.
 * The response contains:
 * \li a status code
 * \li header fields (that may be answers to the ones that you requested)
 * \li a body, which contains the contents of the requested resource
 *
 * acid::Http provides a simple function, SendRequest, to send a acid::HttpRequest and
 * return the corresponding acid::HttpResponse
 * from the server.
