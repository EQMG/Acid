Acid is a high speed, cross-platform, game engine written in C++17. Features are broken down into modules, modules can be added or removed from Acid with ease.

Vulkan is used as the only rendering API, as a result Vulkan can be used directly in games, but should be avoided. Metal is supported through [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK), eventually OpenGL and DirectX will be supported in a similar way.

Acid is licensed under MIT and is open to contributions, use the 'Compiling' section in the [README.md](README.md) to get started with Acid.

 * Frustum culling
 * Resource management
 * Event and tasks systems
 * Resource path searches, and packaging
 * GUI and font rendering
 * Particle effect systems
 * Audio and music
 * Skyboxes and fog
 * Shadow mapping
 * GameObjects and component system
 * Post effects (Lensflare, Glow, Blur, SSAO, ...)
 * Model file loading (OBJ)
 * Animations loading (COLLADA)
 * Image file loading (JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP, PSD, GIF, HDR, PIC)
 * GameObject prefab loading/saving (JSON, XML)
 * Value drivers, timers, vectors, and matrices
 * Flexible input classes
 * C# generated files (WIP)
 * Steam integration (WIP)

## Dependencies
Acid uses the following libraries:
 * [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan) - Vulkan interface
 * [Glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) - Shader compiling
 * [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) - Window creation
 * [OpenAL](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html) - Audio interface
 * [Bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) - Physics integration
 * [PhysFS](https://icculus.org/physfs) - Archive file access
 * [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - Texture and OGG loading
 * [FastNoise](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise) - Noise generation

# Code Snippets
```cpp
// Imports a 2D texture.
auto guiBlack = Texture::Resource("Guis/Black.png");

// Imports a 3D cubemap.
auto skyboxSnowy = Cubemap::Resource("Objects/SkyboxSnowy", ".png");

// Imports a model.
auto dragon = ModelObj::Resource("Objects/Testing/ModelDragon.obj");

// Plays a 3D sound (sound buffer internally managed), at the origin, at half volume.
auto jump = Sound("Sounds/Jump.ogg", SOUND_TYPE_EFFECT, false, true, 0.5f);
jump.SetPosition(10.0f * Vector3::RIGHT);

// Imports a game object (pointer managed by scene after creation).
auto playerObject = new GameObject("Objects/Player/Player.json", Transform());

// Creates a game object.
auto sphere = new GameObject(Transform(Vector3(6.7f, 6.7f, -8.0f), Vector3::ZERO, 3.0f));
sphere->AddComponent<Mesh>(ShapeSphere::Resource(30, 30, 1.0f));
sphere->AddComponent<ShapeSphere>(2.0f);
sphere->AddComponent<Rigidbody>(2.0f);
sphere->AddComponent<MaterialDefault>(Colour::WHITE, Texture::Resource("Objects/Testing/Albedo.png"),
    0.0f, 0.0f, Texture::Resource("Objects/Testing/Material.png"), Texture::Resource("Objects/Testing/Normal.png"));
sphere->AddComponent<MeshRender>();

// Vector maths.
Vector2 a(3.0f, -7.2f);
Vector2 b(-1.74f, 15.4f);
Vector2 c = a * b;
float dist = a.Distance(b);

// Split a string by spaces.
std::string stringSource = "Hello world!";
std::vector<std::string> stringSplit = String::Split(stringSource, " ");

// Will run a lambda after 5 seconds.
Events::Get()->AddEvent<EventTime>(Time::Seconds(5.0f), [&]() -> void
{
	Log::Out("Hello world: %f\n", Maths::Random(-1.0f, 1.0f));
}, false);
```

## Compiling
Once Acid is cloned run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the Acid directory to update the submodules. All platforms depend on [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) to generate IDE/make files.

[Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) and [OpenAL SDK](https://openal-soft.org/#download) are required to develop and run Acid.

Make sure you have environment variables `VULKAN_SDK` and `OPENALDIR` set to the paths you have Vulkan and OpenAL installed into.

Ensure you are using a compiler with full C++17 support, on Windows it is recommend you use MSVC or [MinGW w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/?source=navbar).

If using Visual Studio it must be 2015 or later. Use the Visual Studio installer and select both "Desktop development with C++" and "Windows SDK" if they are not already installed. Then on Visual Studio Acid can be opened as a CMake workspace folder.

On Linux Acid requires `xorg-dev`, `libopenal1`, and `libvulkan1` to be installed. Read about how to setup [Vulkan on Linux](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html) so a Vulkan SDK is found.

Setup on MacOS is similar to the setup on Linux, a compiler that supports C++17 is required, such as XCode 10.0.
