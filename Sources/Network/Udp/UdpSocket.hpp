/**
 * @brief A UDP socket is a connectionless socket. Instead of connecting once to a remote host,
 * like TCP sockets, it can send to and receive from any host at any time.
 * 
 * It is a datagram protocol: bounded blocks of data (datagrams) are transfered
 * over the network rather than a continuous stream of data (TCP).
 * Therefore, one call to send will always match one call to receive (if the datagram is not lost),
 * with the same data that was sent.
 * 
 * The UDP protocol is lightweight but unreliable. Unreliable means that datagrams may be duplicated,
 * be lost or arrive reordered. However, if a datagram arrives, its data is guaranteed to be valid.
 * 
 * UDP is generally used for real-time communication (audio or video streaming, real-time games, etc.)
 * where speed is crucial and lost data doesn't matter much.
 * 
 * Sending and receiving data can use either the low-level or the high-level functions.
 * The low-level functions process a raw sequence of bytes,
 * whereas the high-level interface uses packets (see acid::Packet),
 * which are easier to use and provide more safety regarding the data that is exchanged.
 * You can look at the acid::Packet class to get more details about how they work.
 * 
 * It is important to note that UdpSocket is unable to send datagrams bigger than MaxDatagramSize.
 * In this case, it returns an error and doesn't send anything. This applies to both raw data and packets.
 * Indeed, even packets are unable to split and recompose data, due to the unreliability of the protocol
 * (dropped, mixed or duplicated datagrams may lead to a big mess when trying to recompose a packet).
 * 
 * If the socket is bound to a port, it is automatically unbound from it when the socket is destroyed.
 * However, you can unbind the socket explicitly with the Unbind function if necessary,
 * to stop receiving messages or make the port available for other sockets.
