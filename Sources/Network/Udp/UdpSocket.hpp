	/// <summary>
	/// A UDP socket is a connectionless socket. Instead of connecting once to a remote host,
	/// like TCP sockets, it can send to and receive from any host at any time.
	///
	/// It is a datagram protocol: bounded blocks of data (datagrams) are transfered
	/// over the network rather than a continuous stream of data (TCP).
	/// Therefore, one call to send will always match one call to receive (if the datagram is not lost),
	/// with the same data that was sent.
	///
	/// The UDP protocol is lightweight but unreliable. Unreliable means that datagrams may be duplicated,
	/// be lost or arrive reordered. However, if a datagram arrives, its data is guaranteed to be valid.
	///
	/// UDP is generally used for real-time communication (audio or video streaming, real-time games, etc.)
	/// where speed is crucial and lost data doesn't matter much.
	///
	/// Sending and receiving data can use either the low-level or the high-level functions.
	/// The low-level functions process a raw sequence of bytes,
	/// whereas the high-level interface uses packets (see acid::Packet),
	/// which are easier to use and provide more safety regarding the data that is exchanged.
	/// You can look at the acid::Packet class to get more details about how they work.
	///
	/// It is important to note that UdpSocket is unable to send datagrams bigger than MaxDatagramSize.
	/// In this case, it returns an error and doesn't send anything. This applies to both raw data and packets.
	/// Indeed, even packets are unable to split and recompose data, due to the unreliability of the protocol
	/// (dropped, mixed or duplicated datagrams may lead to a big mess when trying to recompose a packet).
	///
	/// If the socket is bound to a port, it is automatically unbound from it when the socket is destroyed.
	/// However, you can unbind the socket explicitly with the Unbind function if necessary,
	/// to stop receiving messages or make the port available for other sockets.
