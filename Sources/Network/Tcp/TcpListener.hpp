/**
 * @brief A listener socket is a special type of socket that listens to a given port
 * and waits for connections on that port. This is all it can do.
 * 
 * When a new connection is received, you must call accept and the listener returns a
 * new instance of acid::TcpSocket that is properly initialized and can be used to
 * communicate with the new client.
 * 
 * Listener sockets are specific to the TCP protocol, UDP sockets are connectionless
 * and can therefore communicate directly. As a consequence,
 * a listener socket will always return the new connections as acid::TcpSocket instances.
 * 
 * A listener is automatically closed on destruction, like all other types of socket.
 * However if you want to stop listening before the socket is destroyed, you can call its Close() function.
