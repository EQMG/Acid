	/// <summary>
	/// This class mainly defines internal stuff to be used by derived classes.
	///
	/// The only public features that it defines, and which is therefore common
	/// to all the socket classes, is the blocking state.
	/// All sockets can be set as blocking or non-blocking.
	///
	/// In blocking mode, socket functions will hang until the operation completes,
	/// which means that the entire program (well, in fact the current thread if you use multiple ones)
	/// will be stuck waiting for your socket operation to complete.
	///
	/// In non-blocking mode, all the socket functions will return immediately.
	/// If the socket is not ready to complete the requested operation,
	/// the function simply returns the proper status code (Socket::NotReady).
	///
	/// The default mode, which is blocking, is the one that is generally used,
	/// in combination with threads or selectors. The non-blocking mode is rather used in real-time
	/// applications that run an endless loop that can poll the socket often enough,
	/// and cannot afford blocking this loop.
