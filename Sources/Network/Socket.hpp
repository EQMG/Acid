/**
 * @brief This class mainly defines internal stuff to be used by derived classes.
 * 
 * The only public features that it defines, and which is therefore common
 * to all the socket classes, is the blocking state.
 * All sockets can be set as blocking or non-blocking.
 * 
 * In blocking mode, socket functions will hang until the operation completes,
 * which means that the entire program (well, in fact the current thread if you use multiple ones)
 * will be stuck waiting for your socket operation to complete.
 * 
 * In non-blocking mode, all the socket functions will return immediately.
 * If the socket is not ready to complete the requested operation,
 * the function simply returns the proper status code (Socket::NotReady).
 * 
 * The default mode, which is blocking, is the one that is generally used,
 * in combination with threads or selectors. The non-blocking mode is rather used in real-time
 * applications that run an endless loop that can poll the socket often enough,
 * and cannot afford blocking this loop.
