/**
 * @brief A very simple FTP client that allows you to communicate with a FTP server.
 * The FTP protocol allows you to manipulate a remote file system
 * (list files, upload, download, create, remove, ...).
 * 
 * Using the FTP client consists of 4 parts:
 * \li Connecting to the FTP server
 * \li Logging in (either as a registered user or anonymously)
 * \li Sending commands to the server
 * \li Disconnecting (this part can be done implicitly by the destructor)
 * 
 * Every command returns a FTP response, which contains the status code as well as a message from the server.
 * Some commands such as GetWorkingDirectory() and GetDirectoryListing() return additional data,
 * and use a class derived from acid::FtpResponse to provide this data. The most often used
 * commands are directly provided as member functions, but it is also possible
 * to use specific commands with the SendCommand() function.
 * 
 * Note that response statuses >= 1000 are not part of the FTP standard,
 * they are generated by SFML when an internal error occurs.
 * 
 * All commands, especially upload and download, may take some time to complete.
 * This is important to know if you don't want to block your application while
 * the server is completing the task.
