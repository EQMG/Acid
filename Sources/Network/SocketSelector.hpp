/**
 * @brief Socket selectors provide a way to wait until some data is available on a set of sockets,
 * instead of just one. This is convenient when you have multiple sockets that may
 * possibly receive data, but you don't know which one will be ready first.
 * In particular, it avoids to use a thread for each socket; with selectors,
 * a single thread can handle all the sockets.
 * 
 * All types of sockets can be used in a selector:
 * \li acid::TcpListener
 * \li acid::TcpSocket
 * \li acid::UdpSocket
 * 
 * A selector doesn't store its own copies of the sockets (socket classes are not copyable anyway),
 * it simply keeps a reference to the original sockets that you pass to the "add" function.
 * Therefore, you can't use the selector as a socket container, you must store them outside and make sure
 * that they are alive as long as they are used in the selector.
 * 
 * Using a selector is simple:
 * \li populate the selector with all the sockets that you want to observe
 * \li make it wait until there is data available on any of the sockets
 * \li test each socket to find out which ones are ready
