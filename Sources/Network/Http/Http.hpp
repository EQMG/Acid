	/// <summary>
	/// A very simple HTTP client that allows you to communicate with a web server.
	/// You can retrieve web pages, send data to an interactive resource,
	/// download a remote file, etc. The HTTPS protocol is not supported.
	///
	/// The HTTP client is split into 3 classes:
	/// \li acid::HttpRequest
	/// \li acid::HttpResponse
	/// \li acid::Http
	///
	/// acid::HttpRequest builds the request that will be sent to the server. A request is made of:
	/// \li a method (what you want to do)
	/// \li a target URI (usually the name of the web page or file)
	/// \li one or more header fields (options that you can pass to the server)
	/// \li an optional body (for POST requests)
	///
	/// acid::HttpResponse parse the response from the web server and provides getters to read them.
	/// The response contains:
	/// \li a status code
	/// \li header fields (that may be answers to the ones that you requested)
	/// \li a body, which contains the contents of the requested resource
	///
	/// acid::Http provides a simple function, SendRequest, to send a acid::HttpRequest and
	/// return the corresponding acid::HttpResponse
	/// from the server.
