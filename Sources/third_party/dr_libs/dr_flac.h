RELEASE NOTES - v0.12.0
=======================
Version 0.12.0 has breaking API changes including changes to the existing API and the removal of deprecated APIs.


Improved Client-Defined Memory Allocation
-----------------------------------------
The main change with this release is the addition of a more flexible way of implementing custom memory allocation routines. The
existing system of DRFLAC_MALLOC, DRFLAC_REALLOC and DRFLAC_FREE are still in place and will be used by default when no custom
allocation callbacks are specified.

To use the new system, you pass in a pointer to a drflac_allocation_callbacks object to drflac_open() and family, like this:

    void* my_malloc(size_t sz, void* pUserData)
    {
        return malloc(sz);
    }
    void* my_realloc(void* p, size_t sz, void* pUserData)
    {
        return realloc(p, sz);
    }
    void my_free(void* p, void* pUserData)
    {
        free(p);
    }

    ...

    drflac_allocation_callbacks allocationCallbacks;
    allocationCallbacks.pUserData = &myData;
    allocationCallbacks.onMalloc  = my_malloc;
    allocationCallbacks.onRealloc = my_realloc;
    allocationCallbacks.onFree    = my_free;
    drflac* pFlac = drflac_open_file("my_file.flac", &allocationCallbacks);

The advantage of this new system is that it allows you to specify user data which will be passed in to the allocation routines.

Passing in null for the allocation callbacks object will cause dr_flac to use defaults which is the same as DRFLAC_MALLOC,
DRFLAC_REALLOC and DRFLAC_FREE and the equivalent of how it worked in previous versions.

Every API that opens a drflac object now takes this extra parameter. These include the following:

    drflac_open()
    drflac_open_relaxed()
    drflac_open_with_metadata()
    drflac_open_with_metadata_relaxed()
    drflac_open_file()
    drflac_open_file_with_metadata()
    drflac_open_memory()
    drflac_open_memory_with_metadata()
    drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()



Optimizations
-------------
Seeking performance has been greatly improved. A new binary search based seeking algorithm has been introduced which significantly
improves performance over the brute force method which was used when no seek table was present. Seek table based seeking also takes
advantage of the new binary search seeking system to further improve performance there as well. Note that this depends on CRC which
means it will be disabled when DR_FLAC_NO_CRC is used.

The SSE4.1 pipeline has been cleaned up and optimized. You should see some improvements with decoding speed of 24-bit files in
particular. 16-bit streams should also see some improvement.

drflac_read_pcm_frames_s16() has been optimized. Previously this sat on top of drflac_read_pcm_frames_s32() and performed it's s32
to s16 conversion in a second pass. This is now all done in a single pass. This includes SSE2 and ARM NEON optimized paths.

A minor optimization has been implemented for drflac_read_pcm_frames_s32(). This will now use an SSE2 optimized pipeline for stereo
channel reconstruction which is the last part of the decoding process.

The ARM build has seen a few improvements. The CLZ (count leading zeroes) and REV (byte swap) instructions are now used when
compiling with GCC and Clang which is achieved using inline assembly. The CLZ instruction requires ARM architecture version 5 at
compile time and the REV instruction requires ARM architecture version 6.

An ARM NEON optimized pipeline has been implemented. To enable this you'll need to add -mfpu=neon to the command line when compiling.


Removed APIs
------------
The following APIs were deprecated in version 0.11.0 and have been completely removed in version 0.12.0:

    drflac_read_s32()                   -> drflac_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    drflac_read_s16()                   -> drflac_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    drflac_read_f32()                   -> drflac_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    drflac_seek_to_sample()             -> drflac_seek_to_pcm_frame()
    drflac_open_and_decode_s32()        -> drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    drflac_open_and_decode_s16()        -> drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    drflac_open_and_decode_f32()        -> drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    drflac_open_and_decode_file_s32()   -> drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    drflac_open_and_decode_file_s16()   -> drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    drflac_open_and_decode_file_f32()   -> drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    drflac_open_and_decode_memory_s32() -> drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    drflac_open_and_decode_memory_s16() -> drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    drflac_open_and_decode_memory_f32() -> drflac_open_memroy_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()

Prior versions of dr_flac operated on a per-sample basis whereas now it operates on PCM frames. The removed APIs all relate
to the old per-sample APIs. You now need to use the "pcm_frame" versions.
*/


/*
Introduction
============
dr_flac is a single file library. To use it, do something like the following in one .c file.

    ```c
    #define DR_FLAC_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "dr_flac.h"
    ```

You can then #include this file in other parts of the program as you would with any other header file. To decode audio data, do something like the following:

    ```c
    drflac* pFlac = drflac_open_file("MySong.flac", NULL);
    if (pFlac == NULL) {
        // Failed to open FLAC file
    }

    drflac_int32* pSamples = malloc(pFlac->totalPCMFrameCount * pFlac->channels * sizeof(drflac_int32));
    drflac_uint64 numberOfInterleavedSamplesActuallyRead = drflac_read_pcm_frames_s32(pFlac, pFlac->totalPCMFrameCount, pSamples);
    ```

The drflac object represents the decoder. It is a transparent type so all the information you need, such as the number of channels and the bits per sample,
should be directly accessible - just make sure you don't change their values. Samples are always output as interleaved signed 32-bit PCM. In the example above
a native FLAC stream was opened, however dr_flac has seamless support for Ogg encapsulated FLAC streams as well.

You do not need to decode the entire stream in one go - you just specify how many samples you'd like at any given time and the decoder will give you as many
samples as it can, up to the amount requested. Later on when you need the next batch of samples, just call it again. Example:

    ```c
    while (drflac_read_pcm_frames_s32(pFlac, chunkSizeInPCMFrames, pChunkSamples) > 0) {
        do_something();
    }
    ```

You can seek to a specific PCM frame with `drflac_seek_to_pcm_frame()`.

If you just want to quickly decode an entire FLAC file in one go you can do something like this:

    ```c
    unsigned int channels;
    unsigned int sampleRate;
    drflac_uint64 totalPCMFrameCount;
    drflac_int32* pSampleData = drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s32("MySong.flac", &channels, &sampleRate, &totalPCMFrameCount, NULL);
    if (pSampleData == NULL) {
        // Failed to open and decode FLAC file.
    }

    ...

    drflac_free(pSampleData);
    ```

You can read samples as signed 16-bit integer and 32-bit floating-point PCM with the *_s16() and *_f32() family of APIs respectively, but note that these
should be considered lossy.


If you need access to metadata (album art, etc.), use `drflac_open_with_metadata()`, `drflac_open_file_with_metdata()` or `drflac_open_memory_with_metadata()`.
The rationale for keeping these APIs separate is that they're slightly slower than the normal versions and also just a little bit harder to use. dr_flac
reports metadata to the application through the use of a callback, and every metadata block is reported before `drflac_open_with_metdata()` returns.

The main opening APIs (`drflac_open()`, etc.) will fail if the header is not present. The presents a problem in certain scenarios such as broadcast style
streams or internet radio where the header may not be present because the user has started playback mid-stream. To handle this, use the relaxed APIs:
    
    `drflac_open_relaxed()`
    `drflac_open_with_metadata_relaxed()`

It is not recommended to use these APIs for file based streams because a missing header would usually indicate a corrupt or perverse file. In addition, these
APIs can take a long time to initialize because they may need to spend a lot of time finding the first frame.



Build Options
=============
#define these options before including this file.

#define DR_FLAC_NO_STDIO
  Disable `drflac_open_file()` and family.

#define DR_FLAC_NO_OGG
  Disables support for Ogg/FLAC streams.

#define DR_FLAC_BUFFER_SIZE <number>
  Defines the size of the internal buffer to store data from onRead(). This buffer is used to reduce the number of calls back to the client for more data.
  Larger values means more memory, but better performance. My tests show diminishing returns after about 4KB (which is the default). Consider reducing this if
  you have a very efficient implementation of onRead(), or increase it if it's very inefficient. Must be a multiple of 8.

#define DR_FLAC_NO_CRC
  Disables CRC checks. This will offer a performance boost when CRC is unnecessary. This will disable binary search seeking. When seeking, the seek table will
  be used if available. Otherwise the seek will be performed using brute force.

#define DR_FLAC_NO_SIMD
  Disables SIMD optimizations (SSE on x86/x64 architectures, NEON on ARM architectures). Use this if you are having compatibility issues with your compiler.



Notes
=====
- dr_flac does not support changing the sample rate nor channel count mid stream.
- dr_flac is not thread-safe, but its APIs can be called from any thread so long as you do your own synchronization.
- When using Ogg encapsulation, a corrupted metadata block will result in `drflac_open_with_metadata()` and `drflac_open()` returning inconsistent samples due
  to differences in corrupted stream recorvery logic between the two APIs.

Remarks
-------
The offset will never be negative. Whether or not it is relative to the beginning or current position is determined by the "origin" parameter which will be

/*
Opens a FLAC decoder.


Parameters
----------
onRead (in)
    The function to call when data needs to be read from the client.

onSeek (in)
    The function to call when the read position of the client data needs to move.

pUserData (in, optional)
    A pointer to application defined data that will be passed to onRead and onSeek.

pAllocationCallbacks (in, optional)
    A pointer to application defined callbacks for managing memory allocations.


Return Value
------------
Returns a pointer to an object representing the decoder.


Remarks
-------
Close the decoder with `drflac_close()`.

`pAllocationCallbacks` can be NULL in which case it will use `DRFLAC_MALLOC`, `DRFLAC_REALLOC` and `DRFLAC_FREE`.

This function will automatically detect whether or not you are attempting to open a native or Ogg encapsulated FLAC, both of which should work seamlessly
without any manual intervention. Ogg encapsulation also works with multiplexed streams which basically means it can play FLAC encoded audio tracks in videos.

This is the lowest level function for opening a FLAC stream. You can also use `drflac_open_file()` and `drflac_open_memory()` to open the stream from a file or
from a block of memory respectively.

The STREAMINFO block must be present for this to succeed. Use `drflac_open_relaxed()` to open a FLAC stream where the header may not be present.

drflac_open_memory()

DRFLAC_API drflac* drflac_open(drflac_read_proc onRead, drflac_seek_proc onSeek, void* pUserData, const drflac_allocation_callbacks* pAllocationCallbacks);

/*
Opens a FLAC stream with relaxed validation of the header block.


Parameters
----------
onRead (in)
    The function to call when data needs to be read from the client.

onSeek (in)
    The function to call when the read position of the client data needs to move.

container (in)
    Whether or not the FLAC stream is encapsulated using standard FLAC encapsulation or Ogg encapsulation.

pUserData (in, optional)
    A pointer to application defined data that will be passed to onRead and onSeek.

pAllocationCallbacks (in, optional)
    A pointer to application defined callbacks for managing memory allocations.


Return Value
------------
A pointer to an object representing the decoder.


Remarks
-------
The same as drflac_open(), except attempts to open the stream even when a header block is not present.

Because the header is not necessarily available, the caller must explicitly define the container (Native or Ogg). Do not set this to `drflac_container_unknown`
as that is for internal use only.

Opening in relaxed mode will continue reading data from onRead until it finds a valid frame. If a frame is never found it will continue forever. To abort,
force your `onRead` callback to return 0, which dr_flac will use as an indicator that the end of the stream was found.

/*
Opens a FLAC decoder and notifies the caller of the metadata chunks (album art, etc.).


Parameters
----------
onRead (in)
    The function to call when data needs to be read from the client.

onSeek (in)
    The function to call when the read position of the client data needs to move.

onMeta (in)
    The function to call for every metadata block.

pUserData (in, optional)
    A pointer to application defined data that will be passed to onRead, onSeek and onMeta.

pAllocationCallbacks (in, optional)
    A pointer to application defined callbacks for managing memory allocations.


Return Value
------------
A pointer to an object representing the decoder.


Remarks
-------
Close the decoder with `drflac_close()`.

`pAllocationCallbacks` can be NULL in which case it will use `DRFLAC_MALLOC`, `DRFLAC_REALLOC` and `DRFLAC_FREE`.

This is slower than `drflac_open()`, so avoid this one if you don't need metadata. Internally, this will allocate and free memory on the heap for every
metadata block except for STREAMINFO and PADDING blocks.

The caller is notified of the metadata via the `onMeta` callback. All metadata blocks will be handled before the function returns.

The STREAMINFO block must be present for this to succeed. Use `drflac_open_with_metadata_relaxed()` to open a FLAC stream where the header may not be present.

Note that this will behave inconsistently with `drflac_open()` if the stream is an Ogg encapsulated stream and a metadata block is corrupted. This is due to
the way the Ogg stream recovers from corrupted pages. When `drflac_open_with_metadata()` is being used, the open routine will try to read the contents of the
metadata block, whereas `drflac_open()` will simply seek past it (for the sake of efficiency). This inconsistency can result in different samples being
returned depending on whether or not the stream is being opened with metadata.

v0.12.0 - 2019-09-23
  - API CHANGE: Add support for user defined memory allocation routines. This system allows the program to specify their own memory allocation
    routines with a user data pointer for client-specific contextual data. This adds an extra parameter to the end of the following APIs:
    - drflac_open()
    - drflac_open_relaxed()
    - drflac_open_with_metadata()
    - drflac_open_with_metadata_relaxed()
    - drflac_open_file()
    - drflac_open_file_with_metadata()
    - drflac_open_memory()
    - drflac_open_memory_with_metadata()
    - drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    - drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    - drflac_open_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    - drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    - drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    - drflac_open_file_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    - drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_s32()
    - drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_s16()
    - drflac_open_memory_and_read_pcm_frames_f32()
    Set this extra parameter to NULL to use defaults which is the same as the previous behaviour. Setting this NULL will use
    DRFLAC_MALLOC, DRFLAC_REALLOC and DRFLAC_FREE.
  - Remove deprecated APIs:
    - drflac_read_s32()
    - drflac_read_s16()
    - drflac_read_f32()
    - drflac_seek_to_sample()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_s32()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_s16()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_f32()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_file_s32()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_file_s16()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_file_f32()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_memory_s32()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_memory_s16()
    - drflac_open_and_decode_memory_f32()
  - Remove drflac.totalSampleCount which is now replaced with drflac.totalPCMFrameCount. You can emulate drflac.totalSampleCount
    by doing pFlac->totalPCMFrameCount*pFlac->channels.
  - Rename drflac.currentFrame to drflac.currentFLACFrame to remove ambiguity with PCM frames.
  - Fix errors when seeking to the end of a stream.
  - Optimizations to seeking.
  - SSE improvements and optimizations.
  - ARM NEON optimizations.
  - Optimizations to drflac_read_pcm_frames_s16().
  - Optimizations to drflac_read_pcm_frames_s32().

v0.11.10 - 2019-06-26
  - Fix a compiler error.

v0.11.9 - 2019-06-16
  - Silence some ThreadSanitizer warnings.

v0.11.8 - 2019-05-21
  - Fix warnings.

v0.11.7 - 2019-05-06
  - C89 fixes.

v0.11.6 - 2019-05-05
  - Add support for C89.
  - Fix a compiler warning when CRC is disabled.
  - Change license to choice of public domain or MIT-0.

v0.11.5 - 2019-04-19
  - Fix a compiler error with GCC.

v0.11.4 - 2019-04-17
  - Fix some warnings with GCC when compiling with -std=c99.

v0.11.3 - 2019-04-07
  - Silence warnings with GCC.

v0.11.2 - 2019-03-10
  - Fix a warning.

v0.11.1 - 2019-02-17
  - Fix a potential bug with seeking.

v0.11.0 - 2018-12-16
  - API CHANGE: Deprecated drflac_read_s32(), drflac_read_s16() and drflac_read_f32() and replaced them with
    drflac_read_pcm_frames_s32(), drflac_read_pcm_frames_s16() and drflac_read_pcm_frames_f32(). The new APIs take
    and return PCM frame counts instead of sample counts. To upgrade you will need to change the input count by
    dividing it by the channel count, and then do the same with the return value.
  - API_CHANGE: Deprecated drflac_seek_to_sample() and replaced with drflac_seek_to_pcm_frame(). Same rules as
    the changes to drflac_read_*() apply.
  - API CHANGE: Deprecated drflac_open_and_decode_*() and replaced with drflac_open_*_and_read_*(). Same rules as
    the changes to drflac_read_*() apply.
  - Optimizations.

v0.10.0 - 2018-09-11
  - Remove the DR_FLAC_NO_WIN32_IO option and the Win32 file IO functionality. If you need to use Win32 file IO you
    need to do it yourself via the callback API.
  - Fix the clang build.
  - Fix undefined behavior.
  - Fix errors with CUESHEET metdata blocks.
  - Add an API for iterating over each cuesheet track in the CUESHEET metadata block. This works the same way as the
    Vorbis comment API.
  - Other miscellaneous bug fixes, mostly relating to invalid FLAC streams.
  - Minor optimizations.

v0.9.11 - 2018-08-29
  - Fix a bug with sample reconstruction.

  - Start using major.minor.revision versioning.

v0.8g - 2018-04-19
  - Fix build on non-x86/x64 architectures.

v0.8f - 2018-02-02
  - Stop pretending to support changing rate/channels mid stream.

v0.8e - 2018-02-01
  - Fix a crash when the block size of a frame is larger than the maximum block size defined by the FLAC stream.
  - Fix a crash the the Rice partition order is invalid.

v0.8d - 2017-09-22
  - Add support for decoding streams with ID3 tags. ID3 tags are just skipped.

v0.8c - 2017-09-07
  - Fix warning on non-x86/x64 architectures.

v0.8b - 2017-08-19
  - Fix build on non-x86/x64 architectures.

  - A small optimization for the Clang build.

v0.8 - 2017-08-12
  - API CHANGE: Rename dr_* types to drflac_*.
  - Optimizations. This brings dr_flac back to about the same class of efficiency as the reference implementation.
  - Add support for custom implementations of malloc(), realloc(), etc.
  - Add CRC checking to Ogg encapsulated streams.
  - Fix VC++ 6 build. This is only for the C++ compiler. The C compiler is not currently supported.
  - Bug fixes.

v0.7 - 2017-07-23
  - Add support for opening a stream without a header block. To do this, use drflac_open_relaxed() / drflac_open_with_metadata_relaxed().

v0.6 - 2017-07-22
  - Add support for recovering from invalid frames. With this change, dr_flac will simply skip over invalid frames as if they
    never existed. Frames are checked against their sync code, the CRC-8 of the frame header and the CRC-16 of the whole frame.

v0.5 - 2017-07-16
  - Fix typos.
  - Change drflac_bool* types to unsigned.
  - Add CRC checking. This makes dr_flac slower, but can be disabled with #define DR_FLAC_NO_CRC.

v0.4f - 2017-03-10
  - Fix a couple of bugs with the bitstreaming code.

v0.4e - 2017-02-17
  - Fix some warnings.

  - Add support for 32-bit floating-point PCM decoding.
  - Use drflac_int* and drflac_uint* sized types to improve compiler support.
  - Minor improvements to documentation.

v0.4c - 2016-12-26
  - Add support for signed 16-bit integer PCM decoding.

v0.4b - 2016-10-23
  - A minor change to drflac_bool8 and drflac_bool32 types.

v0.4a - 2016-10-11
  - Rename drBool32 to drflac_bool32 for styling consistency.

v0.4 - 2016-09-29
  - API/ABI CHANGE: Use fixed size 32-bit booleans instead of the built-in bool type.
  - API CHANGE: Rename drflac_open_and_decode*() to drflac_open_and_decode*_s32().
  - API CHANGE: Swap the order of "channels" and "sampleRate" parameters in drflac_open_and_decode*(). Rationale for this is to
    keep it consistent with drflac_audio.

v0.3f - 2016-09-21
  - Fix a warning with GCC.

v0.3e - 2016-09-18
  - Fixed a bug where GCC 4.3+ was not getting properly identified.

  - Updated documentation.

v0.3a - 2016-05-15
  - Minor fixes to documentation.

v0.3 - 2016-05-11

  - Bug fixes.

v0.2a - 2016-05-10
  - Made drflac_open_and_decode() more robust.
  - Removed an unused debugging variable

v0.2 - 2016-05-09
  - Added support for Ogg encapsulation.
  - API CHANGE. Have the onSeek callback take a third argument which specifies whether or not the seek
    should be relative to the start or the current position. Also changes the seeking rules such that
    seeking offsets will never be negative.
  - Have drflac_open_and_decode() fail gracefully if the stream has an unknown total sample count.

v0.1b - 2016-05-07
  - Properly close the file handle in drflac_open_file() and family when the decoder fails to initialize.
  - Removed a stale comment.

v0.1a - 2016-05-05
