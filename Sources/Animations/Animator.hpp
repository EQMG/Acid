/**
 * @brief class that contains all the functionality to apply an animation to an animated entity.
 * An Animator instance is associated with just one animated entity.
 * It also keeps track of the running time (in seconds) of the current animation,
 * along with a reference to the currently playing animation for the corresponding entity.
 *
 * An Animator instance needs to be updated every frame, in order for it to keep updating the animation pose of the associated entity.
 * The currently playing animation can be changed at any time using {@link Animator#DoAnimation}.
 * The Animator will keep looping the current animation until a new animation is chosen.
 * The Animator calculates the desired current animation pose by interpolating between the previous and next keyframes of the animation
 * (based on the current animation time). The Animator then updates the transforms all of the joints each frame to match the current desired animation pose.

	/**
	 * This method applies the current pose to a given joint, and all of its descendants.
	 * It does this by getting the desired local-transform for the
	 * current joint, before applying it to the joint. Before applying the
	 * transformations it needs to be converted from local-space to model-space
	 * (so that they are relative to the model's origin, rather than relative to
	 * the parent joint). This can be done by multiplying the local-transform of
	 * the joint with the model-space transform of the parent joint.
	 *
	 * The same thing is then done to all the child joints.
	 *
	 * Finally the inverse of the joint's bind transform is multiplied with the
	 * model-space transform of the joint. This basically "subtracts" the
	 * joint's original bind (no animation applied) transform from the desired
	 * pose transform. The result of this is then the transform required to move
	 * the joint from its original model-space transform to it's desired
	 * model-space posed transform. This is the transform that needs to be
	 * loaded up to the vertex shader and used to transform the vertices into
	 * the current pose.
	 * @param currentPose A map of the local-space transforms for all the joints for the desired pose. The map is indexed by the name of the joint which the transform corresponds to.
	 * @param joint The current joint which the pose should be applied to.
	 * @param parentTransform The desired model-space transform of the parent joint for the pose.
